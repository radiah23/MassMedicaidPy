# MassMedicaidPy

Often it is a hassle to calculate what sort of public health insurance package a user is eligible for given their demographic and conditions.  So we created this package to simplify the calculation for users in **Massachusetts**.  

This package **only focuses on Massachusetts and Medicaid** given the time scope of this course.
